Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity.\n\nAudit tools include, but are not limited to, vendor-provided and open-source audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report generators.\n\nIt is not uncommon for attackers to replace the audit tools or inject code into the existing tools to provide the capability to hide or erase system activity from the audit logs.\n\nTo address this risk, audit tools must be cryptographically signed to provide the capability to identify when the audit tools have been modified, manipulated, or replaced. An example is a checksum hash of the file or files.\n\nSatisfies: SRG-OS-000256-GPOS-00097, SRG-OS-000257-GPOS-00098, SRG-OS-000258-GPOS-00099, SRG-OS-000278-GPOS-00108","false_positives":"","false_negatives":"","documentable":"false","security_override_guidance":"","potential_impacts":"","third_party_tools":"","ia_controls":"","responsibility":"","mitigations":"","mitigation_control":"","ccis":["CCI-001493","CCI-001494","CCI-001495","CCI-001496"],"reference_identifier":"5551","uuid":"5ed62e39-f22b-4ed6-b133-e5d508123ee1","stig_uuid":"d724a272-4c22-4e9f-aea4-c14df3742bf2","status":"not_a_finding","overrides":{},"comments":"","finding_details":"Evaluate-STIG 1.2504.2 (Scan-RHEL9_Checks) found this to be NOT A FINDING on 07/03/2025:\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdvanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) is properly configured to use cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity of audit tools.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n/usr/sbin/auditctl p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n/usr/sbin/auditd p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n/usr/sbin/ausearch p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n/usr/sbin/aureport p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n/usr/sbin/autrace p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n/usr/sbin/augenrules p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512\n\n"},{"group_id_src":"V-258138","group_tree":[{"id":"V-258138","title":"SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227","description":"<GroupDescription></GroupDescription>"}],"group_id":"V-258138","severity":"low","group_title":"RHEL 9 must be configured so that the file integrity tool verifies Access Control Lists (ACLs).","rule_id_src":"SV-258138r1045274_rule","rule_id":"SV-258138r1045274","rule_version":"RHEL-09-651030","rule_title":"RHEL 9 must be configured so that the file integrity tool verifies Access Control Lists (ACLs).","fix_text":"Configure the file integrity tool to check file and directory ACLs. \n\nIf AIDE is installed, ensure the \"acl\" rule is present on all uncommented file and directory selection lists.","weight":"10.0","check_content":"Verify that AIDE is verifying ACLs with the following command:\n\n$ sudo grep acl /etc/aide.conf\n\nAll= p+i+n+u+g+s+m+S+sha512+acl+xattrs+selinux\n\nIf the \"acl\" rule is not being used on all uncommented selection lines in the \"/etc/aide.conf\" file, or ACLs are not being checked by another file integrity tool, this is a finding.","check_content_ref":{"href":"Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_9_STIG.xml","name":"M"},"classification":"UNCLASSIFIED","discussion":"RHEL 9 installation media ships with an optional file integrity tool called Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE).
